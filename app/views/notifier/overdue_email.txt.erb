Hey, <%= @user.name %>! Do your damn chores!
===========================================

Your chore is <%= @chore.title %>, and it's overdue.
It was due on <%= @due_date %>!

And now it shows up as overdue on Chore Room, and everyone knows you're slacking.

If it's still possible to do your chore, then do it and go to <%= @url %> to mark your task completed. If it's not possible anymore, then you really screwed up. Either way, you let us down.
